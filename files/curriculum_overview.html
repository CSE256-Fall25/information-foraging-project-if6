      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School, our curriculum integrates our
        students' social, emotional, physical, intellectual, and creative
        development into a play-based program. We value each child's growth
        and provide additional support through various activities in order to
        meet each student's needs.

        A thorough explanation of Washington University Nursery School’s
        philosophy and educational practices may be found in the
        <a class="download" href="downloads/curriculum_overview.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Overview</a>.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with
            their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development.
            We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, play-
            based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of
            educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a
            learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
              senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning</li>
            <li>Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
              opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
              of peers</li>
            <li>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
              listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
              seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills</li>
            <li>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
              to become problem solvers</li>
            <li>Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
              similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
              unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that
            are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively
            through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
            writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into
            account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child.</p>

            <p>
              At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
              themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
              important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
              process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
              manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
              successful and complete experience.
            </p>

            <p>These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase attention span</li>
              <li>Improve fine motor skills</li>
              <li>Strengthen confidence and emotional well-being</li>
              <li>Build independence</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Materials and experiences include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
              <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials</li>
              <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
              <li>Working with clay and doughs for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
              <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
              <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
              <li>Creating collages from fabrics, paper, pictures, and 3D items</li>
              <li>Building 3D constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and recyclable materials</li>
              <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood, and other materials</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Students enjoy exploring visual arts, music, and drama with specialists, in addition to the artistic
              opportunities in the everyday curriculum.

          <p>The teachers at WUNS observe and assess children’s progress and adapt experiences as needed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Offering one-on-one teacher-student time to understand thinking and build confidence</li>
            <li>Providing more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Simplifying or expanding activities</li>

          <p>
            Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers note activities
            throughout the year to plan and communicate with parents. The Fall conference is informal,
            and the Spring conference includes a formal assessment sent home beforehand.
